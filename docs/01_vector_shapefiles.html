<h3>Load shapefiles with <code>sf</code></h3>
<p>Here’s how to do the same thing using the <code>sf</code> package. Notice two important differences, the <code>sf</code> package reads things in as a regular dataframe, with the spatial component of the data contained inside a <code>geometry</code> <strong>list-column</strong> within the dataframe. That means you can operate on this data as you would any data frame. The other main difference, is that reading shape data in is much faster with <code>sf</code>.</p>

<p>That was easy…what about counties? We can use the same type of call, but let’s add some <code>dplyr</code> and <code>purrr</code> functionality here to add the X and Y values for the centroid of each polygon (county) we download. In this case we use <code>map_dbl</code> because it will take a vector or values (the <code>geometry</code> col here), map a function over each row in that vector, and return a vector of values (the centroid points).</p>

<h3>Using <code>ggplot2</code> and <code>sf</code></h3>
<p>We can use <code>ggplot2</code> to plot our <code>sf</code> data! Many more options using this platform for <code>sf</code>. Mapping with <code>ggplot2</code> brings some extra things we can fiddle with. Since these data are all data.frames (<code>sf</code> features), we can use the <code>geom_sf</code> function.</p>
<p>One important note…there’s a common error that you may get semi-regularly, which will look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>Error in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y,  : 
  polygon edge not found</code></pre>
<p>Don’t worry about this, it has to do with the <code>grid</code> package…it’s annoying but all you need to do is replot your map/figure (sometimes several times) and eventually the plot will work/show up.</p>

<p>Great, this is a nice example…but what if we want to crop to the area of interest like we did previously with the <code>st_bbox</code>? Well, we can add a call to the <code>coord_sf()</code> to limit the range we’re interested in. Let’s also add an “annotation” to our map to delineate the CA state line.</p>
