## Storing Spatial Data with `geopackage`

There are many different ways to save/store spatial data. Some formats changed or been introduced through time, others are simply still used because "that's the way it's always been". One such example is the **shapefile**, which while useful in the context of ArcGIS, using these file types with anything else is a pain...(and it's sort of a pain even with ArcGIS). The main issue is every shapefile is made up of at least 4-7 different files all with different file endings like `.shp`, `.shx`, `.prj`, `.dbj`, etc.). When reading data in, these files all need to be in the same folder, with the same filepath/name. Only problem is when you have lots of these files, file & folder management becomes really exciting. Particularly because most folks probably didn't follow [Jenny Bryan's excellent advice on file naming conventions](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/how-to-name-files). Leading to things like this^[This is from one of my own shared projects. It hurts my eyes just to look at it...but babysteps].

After a recent [twitter exchange](https://twitter.com/_mikoontz/status/1110203545658093568) with a friend and colleague of mine who expressed frustrated shapefiles for additional reasons (truncated field names), but was also was very happy with using the "*geopackage (`.gpkg`)*" format, I realized it was probably worth typing this up and getting it out there. 

### Geopackage (`.gpkg`)

The point of all this is to demonstrate one great way to store any/all the different spatial data types in one single file **`.gpkg`** or ["*geopackage*"](https://www.geopackage.org/), which can be easily shared across platforms, operating systems, programs, etc. It's open-source, plays well with R, Arc, QGIS, and honestly I haven't found a reason **not** to use it yet. 

Geopackage files are SQLite databases that contain the spatial components. We can store a "shapefile" (made up of multiple files) as a single `gpkg` file, or we can actually store *multiple* files in single `gpkg` file! The wonderful thing about this is we can store both the spatial data, the projection/CRS information, along with any additional/associated tables, and all these data are contained in one single file. There's a nice post about using the `gpkg` format [here](https://jsta.rbind.io/blog/2016-07-14-geopackage-r/) in conjunction with the `sp` package...but I'm going give a quick run down on using these file types with the `sf` package. 

### `gpkg` and the `sf` package

With the advent of the `sf` package, it has become so much easier to read/write in just about [any vector-based spatial data file type into R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/vignettes/sf2.html). A few of the ones listed here are just some of the more common forms I run across frequently, but this is by no means an exhaustive list. These are all vector based, and I'm not going to talk about rasters, but `gpkg` works for imagery/raster type files too.

 - `.kml`
 - `.kmz` (the zipped `.kml`)
 - `.shp`
 - `.geojson`
 - `.gpx` (from GPS devices)

So, these all can turn into one file type, which can be easily shared or queried using SQL based tools, or the `sf` package! 

## A Working `gpkg` Example in R

So let's walk through a quick example where we read in 3 different file types, save them all into the same `gpkg` file/database, and read them back in to make sure they are the same (and nothing broke!).

### Load Packages

The packages I'll use for this example are as follows:

```{r libsecho, eval=F, echo=T, message=F, show=FALSE}

library(here)
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)

```

If you haven't used the `here` package, check it out...it's very handy in conjunction with RStudio projects, and dealing with pathnames.

```{r libseval, eval=T, echo=F, message=F, show=FALSE}

suppressPackageStartupMessages({
  library(here);
  library(tidyverse);
  library(sf);
  library(mapview)
})

```

### Load Data

For this example let's use a few different data sets:

 - **.kml** - A cleaned `kml` of USGS gages of California (source: USGS)
 - **.shp** - A shapefile of lighthouses of California (source: CDFW)
 - **.shp** - A shapefile of California Ports (source: CDFW)
 - **.shp** - A shapefile of California Fishing Piers (source: CDFW)
 - **.geojson** - A geojson of open data on ocean trash that's been collected by https://www.coastalcleanupdata.org/. It's a cool site and the data has kindly been made available for use. I went to the Reports tab, downloaded a detailed summary csv for California, and converted it to a geojson (see code chunk below).

```{r makeGeoJSON, echo=T, eval=F, purl=TRUE}

ocean <- read_csv(paste0(here(), "/data/coastal_cleanup_detailed_summary-CA-USA_2019March.csv")) %>% 
  separate(col=GPS, into = c("lat","lon"), sep = ",", remove = T) %>% 
  mutate(lat=as.numeric(lat), 
         lon=as.numeric(lon)) %>% 
  st_as_sf(coords=c("lon", "lat"), crs=4326, remove=FALSE)

st_write(ocean, "data/coastal_cleanup_detailed_summ_CA_2019Mar.geojson")

```

All this data is available as a zipped folder here:

 - [Zipped Example Files]()

Quick note, if you have a **`kmz`** file, you'll need to unzip it first with your computers zip/unzip program (or check out something like 7Zip for Windows/PC or Keka for MacOSX). Once unzipped you should have a *`kml`* which you can use. Ultimately it doesn't matter much what the data type is/was once it's been read into R using `sf`, because it becomes a spatial data frame which can be exported as whatever suits the user best. 

### Read Data into R with `sf`

Let's get all these layers into R using `sf` so we can save them into one single `gpkg` database. **`sf`** commands are fairly simple, and to read things in, we only need `sf_read`.

```{r sfIn, eval=F, echo=T, purl=FALSE}

# read in shps
lighthouses <- st_read(paste0(here(),"/data/CUL_CA_Lighthouses.shp"))
ports <- st_read(paste0(here(),"/data/CUL_CA_Ports.shp"))
piers <- st_read(paste0(here(), "/data/FishingPiers.shp"))

# read in kml
gages <- st_read(paste0(here(), "/data/streamgages_clean.kml"))

# read in geojson
oceantrash <- st_read(paste0(here(),"/data/coastal_cleanup_detailed_summ_CA_2019Mar.geojson"))

```





### Check Projection/CRS

Before we do anything else, we need to make sure everything is in the same projection. Typically this is a good idea regardless of what you are doing, so calculations and analyses all use the same coordinate reference system (CRS). This isn't a requirement for a `gpkg` file, but I recommend doing it. For this example, let's shift everything into [California Albers (EPSG 3310)](https://epsg.io/3310).

```{r fixProjection, echo=T, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}

# check CRS:
st_crs(lighthouses)

# change/set new CRS:
lighthouses <- st_transform(lighthouses, crs = 3310)

# check new CRS is set
st_crs(lighthouses)

# apply to everything else
ports <- st_transform(ports, crs=3310)
piers <- st_transform(piers, crs=3310)
gages <- st_transform(gages, crs=3310)
oceantrash <- st_transform(oceantrash, crs=3310)

```

### Write *TO* geopackage (`gpkg`)

Now we have all the pieces we need, let's create a single `gpkg` file to hold these. Take a quick note of the file sizes here, the `geojson` is ~13 MB, the `shps` aren't big (< 1 MB), and the `kml is about 1.1 MB. So in raw form, total file size ~14.5 MB. 

Just as we have been using `st_` commands, there's nothing special about writing to a `gpkg` file. The only added bit we need is to specify the same `gpkg` file each time, and change the `layer=` argument.

```{r writeGPKG, echo=T, eval=F, purl=FALSE}

st_write(gages, dsn="data/gpkg_in_R_example.gpkg", layer='usgs_gages_clean')
st_write(lighthouses, dsn="data/gpkg_in_R_example.gpkg", layer='lighthouses')
st_write(oceantrash, dsn="data/gpkg_in_R_example.gpkg", layer='oceantrash')
st_write(piers, dsn="data/gpkg_in_R_example.gpkg", layer='piers')

# If an existing layer already exists, to overwrite the LAYER add: ( layer_options = "OVERWRITE=YES" )
st_write(ports, dsn="data/gpkg_in_R_example.gpkg", layer='ports', layer_options = "OVERWRITE=YES" )

# Caution/Note, if you want to overwrite the entire gpkg database file, use "delete_dsn = TRUE". This replaces the file and everything that may have been in it!

```

That's it! Even better, the file size for the total `gpkg` which now has all these files in it, is 2.7 MB!. Overall, I find it a much cleaner and nicer option.

### Read Data FROM geopackage

Ok, and finally, how do we get it back in? Well we can check what layers exist in a given `gpkg` file with the `st_layers` function. Then we read things in a very similar fashion to what we've already used with st_read().

```{r geopackage, eval=T, echo=T, purl=FALSE}

# check available layers from a geopackage
st_layers(dsn = paste0(here(), "/data/gpkg_in_R_example.gpkg"))

st_layers(dsn = paste0(here(), "/data/mapping_in_R_data.gpkg"))
# read in layers to environment
usgs <- st_read(dsn = paste0(here(), "/data/gpkg_in_R_example.gpkg"), layer='usgs_gages_clean')
lighthouses <- st_read(dsn = paste0(here(),"/data/gpkg_in_R_example.gpkg"), layer='lighthouses')
oceantrash <- st_read(paste0(here(),"/data/gpkg_in_R_example.gpkg"), layer='oceantrash')
piers <- st_read(dsn=paste0(here(),"/data/gpkg_in_R_example.gpkg"), layer='piers')
ports <- st_read(dsn=paste0(here(),"/data/gpkg_in_R_example.gpkg"), layer='ports')

```


### A quick Map!

Seems weird to not have a map of something:

```{r mapview, purl=FALSE}

mapview(lighthouses, col.regions="yellow") + mapview(piers, col.regions="gray10")

```
